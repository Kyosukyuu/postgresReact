# postgresReact

A simple repository that uses React and acesses a local Postgresql database via Express routes

## Before starting, make sure an .env file is created with the following variables inside:

DB_NAME (the name of the database)
DB_USER (the name of user)
DB_PW (the password of the user)

## Note:

Perform a `npm i` on the command line for both backend and the client directories to install the respective node packages
